## Needlify users Code of Conduct
  
### Overview
  
All persons registered or not on the Needlify platform are expected to follow the rules of good conduct. These rules apply to any individual or legal entity using this exchange and sharing platform.

Due to the very identity of this platform, you will inevitably read articles with which you do not agree. If this is the case, do not get carried away. Stay calm, take time to think about it and come back a few minutes later.

Needlify is above all a platform for exchange and sharing. You should therefore follow a few rules to keep this platform cool and pleasant. Here is a non-exhaustive list of behaviours that you MUST NOT adopt.
  
  
### Share violent content
  
The content you share will be seen by anyone. Anyone means adults and young people alike can read the articles on this platform. Think about all the people who will be able to see your post and ask if the content is offensive and appropriate.
  
### The topic of the articles
  
Obviously, the articles you write must relate to the theme of the platform. In other words, an article about fairy unicorns in the world of magic stars will, of course, not be accepted. On the other hand, you can deal with subjects concerning new technologies, development, programming, design, entrepreneurship, organization, management, ...
  
### Insults/hate
  
First and foremost, please be aware that in many countries, laws exist to punish hate speech and defamation on the internet. We reserve the right to deal with hateful content and to remove such content when appropriate.
  
### Harassment
  
Harassment in any form is not tolerated.

- The publication of humiliating texts or images,
- Bullying,
- The publication of private messages,
- Insults,
- All other forms of harassment.
  
All these forms of harassment will not be tolerated on this platform.
  
### Inappropriate content for minors
  
Inappropriate or unsuitable content for minors will not be allowed. Violent or sexual content directed at or featuring minors is not permitted.
  
### Discrimination
  
Discrimination, as well as harassment, will not be allowed.
  
### Spam
  
The publication and sharing of similar content repeatedly is not allowed. Likewise, massive account creation will be sanctioned.
  
### Use of bot and automation
  
The use of programs allowing the automation of actions such as :

- The creation of an account,
- The publication of content.
  
is not allowed.
  
### Copyright
  
Respect for copyright is paramount. You must not use content for which you do not have the authorisation of the creator.

### Impersonation
  
Impersonation or pretending to be someone else is not allowed.
  
### Pornography
  
This platform is not intended to share pornographic content. Other platforms are designed for that.
  
### Violation of privacy
  
Content that shares private or personally identifiable information without consent is not allowed. This includes the sharing of credentials, credit card numbers, social security numbers or any other personally identifiable information.
  
### Phishing & malicious content
  
The sharing of malicious and fraudulent content is not permitted. Similarly, sharing malicious code will not be allowed.
  
## If you break any of these rules
  
Depending on the severity of the situation, we will first send you an email asking you to explain your actions. At the same time, your account will receive a warning. After two warnings, your account will be temporarily suspended. If you receive another warning after your account has been reinstated, your account will be deleted.

We reserve the right to delete content that is deemed inappropriate. We hope it doesn't come to that.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
support@needlify.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No

sustained inappropriate behavior.
